# Octanet_August Food Website Landing Page

A landing page is a standalone web page that potential customers can “land” on when they click through from an email, ad, or other digital location. A landing page aims to capture information from contacts in exchange for something of value, such as a retail offer code or business-to-business (B2B) insights in the form of a white paper. Landing pages are different from other web pages in that they don’t live in the evergreen navigation of a website. They serve a specific purpose in a specific moment of an advertising campaign to a target audience.

# Why do I need a landing page?

Landing pages can help you attract new customers through effective digital advertising campaigns. With a dedicated landing page for each of your campaigns, you can effectively target each customer segment to increase conversions and lead generation. Additionally, landing pages can help you attract leads by offering a lead magnet in exchange for customer data.

Landing pages are more focused than other areas of your website, allowing you to give someone information about one specific offering. With only one call-to-action and offer, you can keep your audience focused and prevent distractions that are common with regular websites.




# What should a landing page include?
Effective landing pages have the same elements that improve performance and generate more leads. Landing pages must include:

1. A headline
2. Description of the offer
3. Supporting images and videos
4. Social proof in the form of testimonials or reviews
5. A dedicated form for capturing customer data.
